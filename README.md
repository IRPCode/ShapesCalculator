This is a simple program that splits calculations into several different classes, and uses class inheritance.
Upon the start of the program, it will ask the user to input different values so that the program can then return the surface area and volume of three different objects: a sphere, a cylinder, and a cone.
Upon completion of the calculations, it parses the inputs into strings, and prints them to the console.
Here is an example of how the program's execution may look:
